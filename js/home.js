In this activity, students "read" a photo: first, they identify items in the photo they see; then, they interpret the photo and the story behind it.  Reading a photo requires students to apply their observation skills and take note of even the smallest details.  Observation skills are important for people of all ages and in any career field.  This activity lets students hone these observation skills by deeply studying a photo and using what they see to inform their interpretations of the photo.  Students can carry their developed observation skills with them, beyond an LTP project, into their own personal and academic lives.';
